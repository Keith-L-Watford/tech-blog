# tech-blog

## Description
I was assigned to create a full-stack blog.

Expected Behavior:
A user would go to the website and be able to signup/login. Afterwards, they would be able to create a post with a title and body. 

Actual Behavior:
The front end isnt appropiately connected to the backend.

UPDATE #1: Aug 11th, finally got the front end to serve up. There are still some issues and bugs however, now users can create an account and view the seeded the data.

Update #2: Aug 12th, Logout is working!

## Installation
npm i to install the npms needed. 


## Usage
Click <a href="https://techno-bloggo.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a> for the "deployed" site. 

## Notes
This was the most challenging assignment for me thus far. Between the ammount that had to be tackled and the tight turnaround. I need to review handlebars, middleware and connecting it all to each other. It also didnt help that I had some type errors within the server.js and elsewhere that I had to hunt down and fix. Next time, I will definitely check my work more often throughout the process. 

## Credits
Thanks to my team members for project 2. Setting up that server, helped me realize the problems I had in this one.
